        <h2 class="title is-4">My Role</h2>
          I cooperated with four other designers in this project. We worked closely during the whole process. I played an active role during the whole process and was fully in charge of the design work of the “Home Page”/“Landing Page”, including both the Lo-Fi prototype and the Hi-Fi prototype.

            <p>We subdivided and planned our tasks, then created the process to follow. 
            </p><br>

            <h1 class="title is-3">Research</h1>
            
            <p>First, we learned all the different content within this APP, clearly, to know how the current “Navigation” and “Information Architecture” works. Then, we extracted catalog titles and invited five potential users (who have never used Laugh.ly before) to perform the “Card Sorting” exercise.    
            </p>

            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column is-4 is-offset-2">
                <figure class="image"><img src="../assets/laughly/research_1.jpg" alt="card-sorting-1"></figure>
              </div>

              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Testers classified and grouped different types of content subconsciously, which provided us have a deeper understanding of users’ habits and expectations of this type of product. Also, the results provided a very important data foundation for us when we re-build the information architecture.    
            </p>
            <p>However, from the data, we were hesitant about how to group “Favourite”. We were not sure for the final design. So, we created 2 versions of reordering the content hierarchy. <br>
            <strong>Vision 1:</strong> “Favourite” as the second level menu of “Profile”
                      Remove “Radio” of “Explore” as an individual menu.<br>

            <strong>Vision 2:</strong>  Use “Favourite” as the first level menu
            </p><br><br>
            <div class="columns">

              </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>To help us make the final decision, we established two visions of the “Tree Testing” exercises based on these two visions of reordering the content hierarchy. We invited another five potential users for each vision and gave them tasks to complete. 
            </p>
              <img src="../assets/laughly/tree_testing.png">
            <p>From the test result of the tree testing, we found that <strong>Vision 1</strong>（“Favourite” as the second level menu of “Profile”, remove “Radio” of “Explore” as an individual menu）is more suitable for the user’s mental model.
            </p>

           <h3 class="title is-4">Other important discoveries:</h3> 

           <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most users created the following categories: Search, Social, Radio, Genre, Profile, Premium Content, and Menu.</li>
              <li>Users eventually found the “My Activities” part, but it was not as intuitive as we thought.</li>
              <li>When a user saw the label “Social”, they were not sure what type of content was inside.</li>
              <li>Most users expected to be able to search for and add friends on the “Social” tab.</li>
              <li>Users did not associate Live Streaming with On Demand or Radio.</li>
              <li>The search bar label should be clearer.</li>
            </ul>
           </p>

           <p>Based on this information, we started our next step — sketch different ideas on paper, then discuss and vote to pick the best ideas, so we could begin to make the Lo-Fi prototypes.

            <br>
            <p>After brainstorming in Design Studio, we collaborated all the best ideas and generated Lo-Fi wireframes.

            <h2 class="title is-4">Lo-Fi Validation Findings</h2>
            <p>
            Through this round of testing, we found testers easily finished most of our scenario tasks. But there were still some places they felt confused and had a difficult time to find the proper content. These include: <br><br>
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-5">1. Find and follow a friend – Profile Page</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Four of five users’ first intuition was to go to “Social Feed”.<br>
            Additionally, two users were unaware the search was global.<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>

            <h3 class="title is-5">2.Find list of followers – Social Page</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Users’ first intuition was to go to “Social Feed” to find the follower list.<br>
            <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Because of the name “Social Feed”, users automatically were drawn to find followers.<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>

             <h3 class="title is-5">3. Non-mainstream content</h3>

            <strong>Problem:</strong> Most users (three of five) went to explore, while the other two browsed around and eventually found it in Originals.<br>

          <article>
            <h1 class="title is-3">HI-Fi Phase</h1>
            <h2 class="title is-4">Hi-Fi Prototypes</h2>
            <p>After the Lo-Fi prototype test, we modified and identified most of the design. Then, we started creating the Hi-Fi prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>Laugh.ly has its own design style guide, so in terms of color and font, we strictly abided by the existing norms. But for the Grid System, we thought there was space to improve, so we communicated with clients and started to use a new grid system with their approval.
            </p>
            <h3 class="title is-6">A small Disputes</h3>
              When we created the Hi-fi prototype, Laugh.ly planned to launch the “interactive” function in the next version, but they asked us to test it as the landing page to determine what impact will it would have on users. Also, they wanted us to add “user’s own activities” to this landing page when testing.</p>
            <p>
              But as designers, we had some different opinions on this issue. We think that setting the landing page as “Explore” will provide users a better experience, because “Explore” introduces users to the most important things they care about in laugh.ly —— Comedy content. So, we decided to create <strong>2 visions</strong> 
              of the Hi-Fi prototype to test this.
              <br><strong>Vision 1:</strong> Landing page is “News Feed” (User’s and friends’ activities).
              <br><strong>Vision 2:</strong> Landing page is “Explore” (Comedy content).
            </p> <br><br>
            
            <div class="columns">
              <div class="column">
                <figure class="image"><img src="../assets/laughly/hi_fi_home_explore.jpg" alt="Design Studio"></figure>

              <div class="column">
                <figure class="image"><img src="../assets/laughly/hi_fi_home_news_feed.jpg" alt="Design Studio"></figure>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="title is-4">Hi-Fi Validation Insights and Synthesis</h2>
              <p>
              In this round of testing, we tested five different users for each vision. Every user not only needed to complete the same scenario tasks in the Lo-Fi prototype test, but also needed to answer several more questions which included some content we could not test during the Lo-Fi validation.
              </p>
              We found that the users could successfully complete most of the problems that we had in the Lo-Fi prototype.
              </p><br>
              <p>
              But still, there were some issues to be fixed:
              </p>
            
            <h3 class="title is-6">1. Album Recently Played </h3>
              <p>
              <strong>Problem:</strong> Users went directly to Profile when prompted to look for an album they had recently played but not saved.<br>
              <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> It is not intuitive for users to go to the News feed when looking for their own recent activities.<br>
              <strong>Solution:</strong> A recently played section, if desired, should be in the Profile section. Learnability of the placement of “my activities” can be tested with experienced users and analytics should provide insights.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">2. Finding offline saved content</h3>
              <p>
              <strong>Problem:</strong> Some users went directly to “exclusive” while others went to the “saved” screen but did not see the offline section.<br>
              <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Styling of the “offline” carousel in the “saved” screen is distracting and users overlooked the label. Some users also automatically associated “offline” with “exclusive” because they believe all premium content should be in “exclusive”.<br>
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Use visual hierarchy to emphasize the offline section saved under (......)Add “offline” to the “exclusive” section so it can be found in two areas of the app for premium users.
              </p>
          
            <h3 class="title is-6">3. Feel confused when they saw the landing page as “Activities”</h3>
              <p>
              <strong>Problem:</strong> Four of five users of vision #2 explicitly mentioned that they did not expect the friend’s activity feed on the home screen. They feel overwhelmed when they open this APP. They also mentioned that “Friends’ activities” is not their primary concern. <br>
              <strong>Solution:</strong> This confirms our previous thinking that “Explore” as the landing page will give users a better user experience.
              </p><br>

              <p>
              In the end, the Laugh.ly team were very satisfied with our final deliverables and all the user research results. Also, they were happy we gave them some suggestions (e.g., new grid system, set “Explore” as the landing page).Furthermore, in the latest version of Laugh.ly, we were excited to find our design had been put into practice and released.

            <h1 id="laughly-Design-Process" class="title has-text-centered is-2">What I learned from this project</h1><br>

              <p>
                This was a great project to work on. I am very appreciative for the opportunity to participate on this project. I’m also very grateful to work with the other four excellent designers, and very happy that my ideas and designs can impact many active users.<br>
                Two important things I learned from this project:
              </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">1. The importance of users’ feedback for design</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, because of the need for navigation flow and information architecture redesign, a large amount of user research is involved. If we did not have all the data and insights directly from the users, we could not devise reasonable solutions, it probably would deviate from the users’ accustomed. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, how to choose and use the right research method is equally important. This project provided me with good practice of the “Card Sorting” and “Tree Testing” techniques. We got valuable data and ultimately could deliver a reasonable solution. 
              </p>

            <h3 class="title is-6">2. How to improve existing products, without deviating from the brand image and philosophy at the same time.</h3>
              <p>
                Laugh.ly already had a large user base and a very clear design style guide. So, one large challenge of this project was how to break the existing pattern, but not deviate from its original philosophy. To achieve this goal, we did not think about the style guide at all when brainstorming so we could generate as many good ideas as possible. Then, we based the design on the style guide to keep on improving. Ultimately, we successfully completed all the design requirements.  
              </p>
