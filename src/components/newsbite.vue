        <h3 class="title is-4">Interaction Design</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to let users intuitively realize that this is different from traditional news platforms, articles they can read on NewsBite are neutral and provide different perspectives of topics. We encountered several challenges, then we explored different possibilities to show the concept.

        <h3 class="title is-4">Branding Exploration</h3>
          <p>We encountered some issues we did not expect before we started the branding exercise. NewsBite has two co-founders. When we communicated with them about their expectation of branding, we received different opinions from each of them. For example, the same car, Founder A thinks is “classic”, but founder B thinks it is “too old”. So, we decided to have a “Branding Workshop” to finalize the direction we all agreed to proceed.

          <p>We prepared about 80 pictures with various random objects. (Car, bike lamp, cup, brands, etc.). In the end, we used their consensus to create the word cloud of “Like” and “Dislike”, and we obtained these important branding references, as shown in the picture below.

          We are very clear what type of fonts we are looking for: High-definition, easy to read, timeless, and match the brand image. We compared many fonts.

         <p>
          When we were working on colors, we first researched and analyzed some brands people think are “trustworthy”, as well as colors of some existing news platforms. Then, we combined and compared them with the brand image, to reveal the following:

          <p>
            We identified “Teal” as the main brand color. “Teal” means “Communication”, “Trustworthiness”, “Reliable”, and “clarity of thought” in Psychology. Also, because “Teal” is not a common color, it makes this brand more identifiable and different from other existing news platforms.
